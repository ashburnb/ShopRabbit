# Shop Rabbit
A Kodeco iOS Bootcamp Capstone Project which is models a fully functioning front end for shopping application built with Swift/SwiftUI. The app displays a full product catalog from www.fakeapistore.com. 

## Capstone Requirements and how each is met

1. The app has a README file including: A basic explanation of the app, as well as explanations of how your app fulfills each of the rubric items. Identify your features and any specific file names so that your mentor doesn’t have to search for them while grading.
COMPLETED - This README details how each metric for the Capstone is met and/or surpassed.

2. The app has a splash screen suitable for the app. It can be either a static or animated splash screen.
COMPLETED - A LaunchscreenView and LaunchscreenViewModel control the animation in and out.

3. All features in the app should be completed. Any unfinished feature should be commented out.
COMPLETED - Shop Rabbit is fully functional and all old code from non-relevant assignments has been removed from the CAPSTONE branch.

4. The app has at least one screen with a list using a view of your choice (List, grid .. etc). 
Each item in the list should contain (as a minimum) a name, a sub-title/description, and an image of the item - the text should be styled appropriately. 
Pressing on items in this list should lead to detail pages - this should show the same data in the list with some further details such as a longer description, bigger picture, price, and a Buy/Order button. 
Include enough items to ensure that the user has to scroll the list to see all the items in it. 
This should appear in a tab view with at least two tabs.
The app has one or more network call(s) to download/upload data that relates to the core tasks of the app. 
The app handles all typical errors related to network calls.
Including at least: No network connection, server error.
The app uses at least one way to save data: userdefaults, keychain, or local database. Please list your method in the Readme.
The app communicates to the user whenever data is missing or empty, the reason for that condition, and a step to take in order to move forward. In other words, no blank screens. The user should never “feel” lost.  For example, whenever there are no items, such as when the data cannot be loaded, explain it).
All included screens work successfully without crashes or UI issues. 
App works for both landscape and portrait orientations.
App works for both light and dark modes.
No obvious UI issues.
The code should be organized and easily readable.
Project source files are organized in folders such as Views, Models, etc.
View components are abstracted into separate Views and source files.
The project utilizes SwiftLint. (The rules installed by default are sufficient.)

The code has both UI and unit testing with a minimum of 50% code coverage.
All test cases pass
